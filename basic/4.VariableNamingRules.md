Python’s naming rules for variables help maintain clear and error-free code:

● Variable names must start with a letter or underscore but not a digit. This prevents
ambiguity in naming.

● Best Practices: Variable names should be descriptive and use snake_case for
readability. Avoid using built-in keywords (e.g., if, for, print) as variable names, as
this can lead to syntax errors or unexpected behavior.
