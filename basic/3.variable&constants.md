In Python, a variable is a reference to a location in memory where data is stored.
Variables can change values over time, making them useful for data that might vary.

Constants represent fixed values. 
Python does not have built-in support for constants, so by convention, programmers use uppercase letters (e.g., PI = 3.14159) to signal that the value should remain constant.
