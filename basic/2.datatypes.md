Python’s fundamental data types are used to represent different forms of data. Each data
type has specific operations associated with it:

● Numbers: Integers (int) are whole numbers, float represents decimal numbers, and
complex includes real and imaginary parts (e.g., 3 + 4j).

● Strings: Strings are a sequence of characters and are immutable, meaning once
created, they cannot be changed. They support operations like slicing, concatenation,
and advanced formatting.

● Booleans: The bool type only has two values: True and False. It’s commonly used in
conditional expressions.

Python also provides complex data structures like lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries, enabling
more advanced data handling.
