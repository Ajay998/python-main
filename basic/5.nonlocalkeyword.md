The nonlocal keyword allows you to access a variable in the nearest enclosing scope that isn’t global. 

This is useful in nested functions, where a variable in the outer function needs to be modified by the inner function. 

Without nonlocal, the inner function would treat any reassignment of that variable as local.

The nonlocal keyword also helps avoid creating accidental local copies of a variable, allowing the nested function to influence the outer function’s state.

def outer():
    count = 0  # Enclosing scope variable

    def inner():
        nonlocal count  # Refers to count in outer()
        count += 1
        print("Inner count:", count)

    inner()
    inner()
    print("Final count:", count)

outer()

Output:
Inner count: 1
Inner count: 2
Final count: 2


Without nonlocal, you'd get an UnboundLocalError because Python would treat count as a local variable in inner() but it's not initialized there.
