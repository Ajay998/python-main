The break statement immediately exits a loop when a specified condition is met, making it useful for stopping loop execution early. 

Conversely, the continue statement skips the rest of the current iteration and jumps to the next one, 
allowing you to filter out unwanted conditions.

# Example with break and continue
for num in range(1, 10):
 if num == 5:
 break # Stops the loop entirely when num is 5
 if num % 2 == 0:
 continue # Skips even numbers
 print(num)
